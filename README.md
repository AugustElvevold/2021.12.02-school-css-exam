## Description
This project, a submission for the Kreativt Webprosjekt course, is a creative and interactive website centered around a LEGO theme. Developed as a collaborative effort, the website features five interconnected pages, each contributing to a unique story told through the journey of a LEGO man. From tumbling in space to traversing oceans, each page offers different interactive animations and elements that engage the user in the LEGO man’s adventures.

### Beginning in Space (Page 1)
- As you land on Page 1, the cosmic setting is laid out with animated meteors and satellites in the space backdrop.
- Witness a striking animation of a meteor colliding with a satellite.
- The collision shakes the LEGO block at the center which jolts the LEGO man out, who then begins to fall out of the frame, marking the start of the adventurous journey.
- As the LEGO man disappears from view, the "Go to next page" button emerges. Click it to follow the LEGO man into the depths of the ocean on Page 2.

### Descending into the Ocean (Page 2)
- Follow the LEGO man as he descends into the ocean.
- Scroll down to the bottom of the ocean and interact with the blinking elements: a LEGO contraption and a chest.
- Open the chest to view a map with a hint.
- Scroll back up to find and click the hidden shark. This activates an animation where the shark attacks the LEGO man.
- Upon the LEGO man floating upwards, a "Go to next page" button appears, leading to Page 3.

### Emerging on the Beach (Page 3)
- Observe the LEGO man coming out of the ocean onto a beach.
- Click the chest on the beach to initiate an animation of a cannon being built.
- Watch as the LEGO man enters the cannon and gets shot to the next page.
- A "Go to next page" button appears post-animation, leading to Page 4.

### The Crash and Conclusion (Page 4)
